# nom-indent

Significant whitespace indentation for `nom` with `nom-locate` support.

This is a surprisingly hard problem with no readily available solutions, so I have made a quick crate. It was written for use in the `astryx programming language`, but could be adapted to any whitespace significant indented syntax.
